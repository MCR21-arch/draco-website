The current focus of this research project is to build upon existing research on side-channel-resistant architectures using partially homomorphic encryption. Our goal is to test and analyze how these systems will work in hardware, rather than just in simulation. We will be building
off of a paper titled "E3X" which describes an ISA for a side-channel resistant architecture using partially homomorphic cryptosystem.
